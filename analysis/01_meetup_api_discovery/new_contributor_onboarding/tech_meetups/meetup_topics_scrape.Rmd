Get a list of Tech Meetup topics from Meetup.com. They don't seem to have an easy way to do this in the API (or else I just haven't found it).
```{r}
download.file("https://www.meetup.com/topics/", meetup_topics_html_file)
```

```{r}
topics_html <- read_html(meetup_topics_html_file)

topics <- topics_html %>% 
  html_nodes("#meetupBody > div.view > section:nth-child(34) > div > ul")

links <- topics %>% 
  html_nodes("li > a") %>%
  html_attr("href")

names <- topics %>% 
  html_nodes("li > a") %>%
  html_text()

topics_df <- data_frame(links=links, names=names)

```
